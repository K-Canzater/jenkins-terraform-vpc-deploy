# ðŸš€ QA-Focused AWS VPC Deployment Automation

## Project Overview:
This project demonstrates **automated, validated deployment of AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure** using Terraform and Jenkins CI/CD pipelines. Emphasis is on **repeatable, error-free infrastructure provisioning**, aligned with QA principles of consistency, auditing, and defect prevention.

---
## QA-Relevant Goals:

- Validate that all infrastructure components (VPC, subnets, route tables, IGW, security groups) are deployed as specified
- Ensure repeatable provisioning with zero manual steps
- Document deployment processes for audit and reproducibility
- Test infrastructure integrity via CI/CD validation workflow
---
## Skills Demonstrated (QA-Related):

- Infrastructure validation using Terraform plan/apply checks
- Automation of deployment testing through Jenkins pipelines
- Secure and auditable management of infrastructure state (S3 + DynamoDB)
- Process-oriented workflow design ensuring reliable environment setup
---
## Tech Stack:
- Terraform | Jenkins | AWS (VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateway, Security Groups) | S3 & DynamoDB | GitHub

## Impact / QA Takeaway:

- Highlights ability to **verify infrastructure meets specifications consistently**
- Shows strong **process adherence, auditing mindset, and automation skills**
- Demonstrates readiness for QA roles requiring **validation of complex systems, test automation, and procedural documentation**
